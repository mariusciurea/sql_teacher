# 🧑‍🏫 SQL Teacher — Multi-Agent Learning System (Google ADK Project)

## 📘 Overview
**SQL Teacher** is a multi-agent application built with **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)** that helps users **learn, practice, and understand SQL interactively**.  
Through natural conversation, users can:
- Design and create database schemas
- Execute CRUD operations in a live in-memory database
- Understand SQL queries step-by-step
- Generate quizzes to test their SQL knowledge

Each specialized agent handles a different part of the SQL learning journey, coordinated by a main **TeacherAgent**.

## 🧠 Agents and Their Responsibilities

### **1️⃣ TeacherAgent (Main Orchestrator)**
Acts as the **central brain** of the system.  
It receives user input and delegates tasks to the appropriate sub-agents.  
Responsibilities:
- Interprets user intent  
- Routes queries to the correct agent  
- Maintains conversational flow and context  
- Combines sub-agent outputs into coherent responses  

---

### **2️⃣ SchemaDesignerAgent**
Responsible for creating and modifying the database schema.  
Users can describe tables and relationships in natural language, and this agent generates the corresponding `CREATE TABLE` statements.  
Outputs are executed by the `MemoryAgent`.

**Example:**
> User: “Create a database with students and courses.”  
> → Generates:
> ```sql
> CREATE TABLE students (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);
> CREATE TABLE courses (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, title TEXT);
> ```

---

### **3️⃣ MemoryAgent**
Executes **all SQL commands** within an **in-memory SQLite database**.  
This is the system’s execution layer — it performs all CRUD operations and returns structured results.

Responsibilities:
- Run schema creation, insert, update, delete, and select commands  
- Maintain the in-memory database during a session  
- Return query results or error details in structured JSON format  

**Tool Used:**  
`db_interactions(sql_command: str)` — executes SQL statements using `sqlite3.connect(":memory:")`.

---

### **4️⃣ QueryExplainerAgent**
Explains **how and why** a specific SQL query works.  
It provides step-by-step explanations for each clause (`SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `JOIN`, etc.), helping the learner understand query logic and execution order.

**Example:**
> User: “Explain what this query does:  
> ```sql
> SELECT name FROM students WHERE age > 20;
> ```  
> → Agent response:  
> “This query retrieves the names of students older than 20 from the ‘students’ table.”

---

### **5️⃣ QuizAgent**
Generates interactive **SQL quizzes (quizzes)** to test user understanding.  
It creates randomized or adaptive multiple-choice questions based on previous topics discussed with the user.

Responsibilities:
- Generate beginner-to-advanced SQL quizzes  
- Evaluate user answers and provide feedback  
- Adapt difficulty based on performance  
- Cover topics such as schema design, SELECT queries, JOINs, and data manipulation  

**Example Interaction:**
> QuizAgent: “What does the following query return?  
> ```sql
> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR';
> ```  
> A) Lists all HR employees  
> B) Returns the total number of HR employees ✅  
> C) Updates HR department records  
> D) Deletes HR employees”

---

## 🧰 Tools

### `db_connector.py`
Handles database connection logic (using SQLite in-memory DB).

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The **user** interacts with the `TeacherAgent`.  
2. The `TeacherAgent` identifies intent and routes the request:
   - Schema creation → `SchemaDesignerAgent`
   - SQL execution → `MemoryAgent`
   - Query explanation → `QueryExplainerAgent`
   - Quiz generation → `QuizAgent`
3. Results are processed, formatted, and returned to the user conversationally.

## 🧑‍💻 Run the Project

### **1️⃣ Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2️⃣ Set up environment

Create a .env file in the root directory with this data:
```.env
GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=False
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your google API Key
```
3️⃣ Run the application
1. First method - using the built in ADK command
   * Go to your project root directory
   * Open a terminal and type the following command
    ```bash
    adk web
    ```
2. Second method - using the **FastAPI** app object
* Open a terminal
* Run:
  *    ```python main.py``` on Windows 
  * ```python3 main.py``` on MAC or Linux systems


A FastApi server will open, with a nice frontend interface so you can test 
the app. Please note that this interface is mostly used for development and 
not in production.
